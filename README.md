Memory Gmae, a player is presented with a number of cards. Each card has a number on one side and is blank (empty) from the other side. To start the game, the player is asked to choose the number of cards to play (4, 8 or 12). After that, they will see the cards on the screen with random numbers

to click on the cards in ascending order of the numbers that are on the other side.

Example turn:
  - Player chooses 4 cards.
  - Cards are displayed with numbers: 34, 10, 12, 45.
  - Cards are flipped to the blank side.
  - Player click on the 10 cards followed by 12, 35, 45
  - Player wins..


### Tech

Memory game uses a number of open source projects to work properly:


* [node.js] - evented I/O for the backend
* [Express] - fast node.js network app framework 



### Installation

Memory Game requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v4+ to run.

Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

```sh
$ npm install
$ npm  start
```

For production environments...

```sh
$ npm install --production
$ npm run build
```


### Development


### `npm start`git 

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
